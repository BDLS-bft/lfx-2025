# First Task Goals

## Goal 1: Understanding cmd/emucon/main.go

My primary objective is to thoroughly understand the `cmd/emucon/main.go` file, which appears to be the main entry point for the emucon component. This involves:

- Analyzing the code structure and architecture
- Understanding the main function flow and logic
- Identifying key dependencies and imports
- Comprehending the functionality of the emucon

## OBSERVATIONS AND QUESTIONS
- when i just ran two (./emucon run --id 0 --listen ":4680" && ./emucon run --id 1 --listen ":4681"), it was acting like static, when ran 3 it just became dynamic ( Why ? )
- what do command like (./emucon run --id 0 --listen ":4680") do and how ?

## MY ANSWERS TO MY QUESTIONS
